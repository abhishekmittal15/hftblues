# Doubts 

1. On page 37 of Bluespec Resources, it says `=` is strictly for static assignment, but what does static mean? For example in the Bubblesort example where I am generating a new random value using LFSR, am I not assigning values during runtime, so I shouldnt use `=` but I am using it, why ?
2. For some reason when I make the interface name start with a lowercase, then it throws an error saying `unexpected identifier` , but when I make it `Sort_ifc` then it works fine
